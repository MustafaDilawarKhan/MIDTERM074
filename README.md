Customer Loyalty Points with RedempƟon
DescripƟon:

Implement a system for tracking customer loyalty points.

Prompt the user to enter the total amount of a purchase.

Calculate and display the loyalty points earned based on a fixed conversion rate (e.g.,
1 point for every $10 spent).

Allow the user to redeem a porƟon of their points for a discount on a future purchase.
For example, allow redempƟon of 10 points for a $5 discount.

Use a loop to simulate mulƟple purchases and redempƟons within a single session.
